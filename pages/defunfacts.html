            <h1>Fun Facts and Phrases from Learning German</h1>
            <h2>Menu</h2>
            <p><a href="../index.html">Homepage</a></p>
            <p><a href="iteration.html">Iteration:</a> My first ever webpage</p>
            <p>I find a lot of the words in German to be very quaint, funny, entertaining, or enlightening. These moments make my eyes sparkle, and are the reason I've continued to learn German for 2 years now. On this webpage, I'll keep a list of the words, phrases, and ideas that have brought me joy. </p>
            <h2>Animals, bugs, and other living things</h2>
            <ul> 
                <li lang="de">die Zimmtschnecke</li>

                <li lang="de">das Faultier</li>
                <p>The sloth is called the lazy animal</p>

                <li lang="de">das Stinktier</li>
                <p>The skunk is called the stinky animal</p>
                <!-- Insert image: skunk with clothes pin on his nose -->

            <h2>Mundane, but <em>OMG that makes so much sense!</em></h2>
            <ul> 
                <li lang="de">die Inhalte</li>
                    <p>Contents are called in-holds, because the contents are what is held inside.</p></li>
                <li lang="de">der Ratschlag</li>
                    <p>A piece of advice is an advice blow. <em lang="de">Schlag</em> means blow or hit or punch. It's the same word that is used for drums. It makes me think about all the times we get advice that we don't really want to hear.</p>
                <li lang="de">die Fachleute</li>
                    <p>Specialists are called subject people. <em lang="de">Fach</em> means subject like a subject in school, and <em lang="de">Leute</em> means people.</p>
            </ul>
            <h2>Same as in English, I just never thought about it in English</h2>
            <ul>
                <li lang="de">die Mikrowelle</li>
                <p>Just like in English micro(tiny) wave(like the ocean or sound or light) We name the kitchen appliance that makes our food hot after the tiny electromagnetic waves that it emits. Duh, why did I never realize that?</p>
