            <h1>Fun Facts and Phrases from Learning German</h1>
            <p>I find a lot of the words in German to be very quaint, funny, entertaining, or enlightening. These moments make my eyes sparkle, and are the reason I've continued to learn German for 2 years now. On this webpage, I'll keep a list of the words, phrases, and ideas that have brought me joy. </p>
