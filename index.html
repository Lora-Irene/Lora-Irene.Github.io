        <h1>Iteration:</h1>
        <h2>Failing on Purpose, for a Purpose</h2>
        <p>Be brave enough to be bad at something new. 
            For instance, this website is really ugly right now. It's colorless, has no buttons, no links, and does nothing. 
            Also, it's literally the best website I've ever made from scratch. (I'm not counting the WordPress website I set up however many years ago.)
            This is my second or third day ever using HTML, Visual Studio Code, and GitHub. The process of iteration is much more important than the beauty
            or lack thereof.</p>
        <p>Here's a cat photo to make it cuter!</p>

        <p>Do you see the other two kitties in the background of this photo?</p>
